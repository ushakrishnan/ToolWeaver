# Parallel Agents (Dispatch)

Run many agents/tools in parallel with guardrails for cost, time, and safety.

## What this shows
- Formatting prompts from argument lists
- Enforcing max_parallel and resource limits
- Using a custom executor function
- Aggregating results (rank/vote) safely

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
```

## Files
- `main.py` — minimal runnable example using `dispatch_agents`
