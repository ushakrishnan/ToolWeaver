## 🎲 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Open source gets forked by competitor
**Mitigation:** 
- Apache 2.0 allows forks (expected)
- Enterprise features stay closed
- Brand & community are defensible
- Continuous innovation

**Risk:** Large player (OpenAI/Anthropic) builds this
**Mitigation:**
- They focus on models, not orchestration
- We're more specialized
- Open source creates moat
- Fast iteration

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Can't monetize open source
**Mitigation:**
- GitLab, MongoDB prove model works
- Enterprise features have clear value
- SaaS convenience sells itself
- Multiple revenue streams

**Risk:** Market too small
**Mitigation:**
- Every AI app needs orchestration
- $5B+ TAM (ML infrastructure)
- Growing 40% YoY
- Early mover advantage

### Execution Risks

**Risk:** Can't build SaaS alone
**Mitigation:**
- Start simple (API + billing)
- Use managed services
- Hire when revenue justifies
- Bootstrap approach
