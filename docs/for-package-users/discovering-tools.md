# Discovering Tools

Discovery APIs (`get_available_tools`, `search_tools`, `get_tool_info`) will arrive in Phase 1.6.

What to expect:
- List/filter tools by domain/status/tags
- Semantic search with optional vector backends
- CLI commands: `toolweaver tools list/search/info`

Current status: placeholders exist in the public API to keep imports stable while foundations are completed.
