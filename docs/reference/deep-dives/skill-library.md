# Skill Library

Managing reusable skills as packaged tools.

Key actions
- Save tools as skills for reuse (`save_tool_as_skill`).
- Load skills where needed (`load_tool_from_skill`).
- Sync updates from source tools back to skills.
- List skill-backed tools to audit coverage.

Hygiene tips
- Version skills and record domains/descriptions consistently.
- Re-run validation after upgrades to catch schema drift.
- Store skills in a controlled path/shared store for teams.
