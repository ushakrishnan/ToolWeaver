# Comparison & Fit

ToolWeaver vs DIY scripts/frameworks:

## DIY scripts
- Pros: maximum control, tailored
- Cons: re-implement guardrails, caching, discovery, observability; hard to scale

## Heavy frameworks
- Pros: batteries included, rich ecosystems
- Cons: higher coupling, opinionated runtime; harder to embed in existing apps

## ToolWeaver
- Library-first: drop into your stack with pip install
- Focused: orchestrates tools/agents with safety and performance
- Composable: use decorators, templates, YAML; expose REST when needed
