# Sample: Programmatic Execution with Progressive Disclosure

**Status:** 🚧 Coming Soon

This sample will demonstrate programmatic execution where AI models generate code that explores and imports tools on-demand, achieving 30-80% context reduction.

## What This Will Include

- Simple tool catalog setup
- Stub generation demonstration
- Progressive discovery workflow
- Context reduction comparison
- Production usage examples

## For Now

See the development examples in [examples/14-programmatic-execution/](../../examples/14-programmatic-execution/) for working demonstrations.

## Prerequisites (When Ready)

```bash
pip install toolweaver
```

No API keys required - runs entirely local with mock tools.

**Note:** This sample is under development. Check back soon!
